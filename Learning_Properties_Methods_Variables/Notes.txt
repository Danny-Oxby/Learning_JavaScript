Javascript code can be run in the projects powershell console
by typing 'node name.js' where name is the file name

Javascript regions are done in the comments using '//#region name' and '//#endregion'

in JavaScript property values, defined by let, are dynamic allowing them to be changed during runtime
this means a let intVar = 3 can leter be changed to intVar = 'three' without issue

onbjects properties can be access using two methods
the dot. method << object.property << for general usage
the ['bracket'] method << object['property'] << for when you dont know the target at runtime e.g. searches << searching for a property that dosn't exist here will retrun undefined

Keywords:

let << property decleration, not type safe, this is for all property types
const << a constant property, unchangnable, any changes will though a console error
typeof << function to retunr the string name matching a properties name
{} << object dinotion, putting 'let x = {}' defines x as a type of object
[] << array decleration
function << method/function decleration
