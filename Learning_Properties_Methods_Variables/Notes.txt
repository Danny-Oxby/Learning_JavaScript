Javascript code can be run in the projects powershell console
by typing 'node name.js' where name is the file name

Javascript regions are done in the comments using '//#region name' and '//#endregion'

in JavaScript property values, defined by let, are dynamic allowing them to be changed during runtime
this means a let intVar = 3 can leter be changed to intVar = 'three' without issue
